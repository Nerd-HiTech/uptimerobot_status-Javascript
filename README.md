uptimerobot_status-Javascript
=============================

This is a script that uses UptimeRobot API to create a table with Uptime Status of your servers.
The script updates every 5 minutes, so you won't need to update your page to change it.

#Instalation

2. Change the api_uptimerobot to an API code generated at your dashboard at uptimerobod.com.
3. Change the danger_percentage to meet your requeriments.
4. Have fun.

##Contribute
Please, if you make changes in this files, make pull request. I'll love to see what you worked and, probably, I'll accept the code.

###Other Version
There's a PHP version of this script here. You could use this version if you need more security, because it'll not send your API key to the user.
